That it “looks like I don’t do anything,” and I’m “always off away from the lab.” I post “too many photos of having fun,” and am generally far too cheery when folks ask me how I’m doing. Apparently, “fantastic!” and “living the dream!” are inappropriate responses to this question. It’s as if having fun, enjoying my lab, loving the fact that my work is the bomb-diggity, means that I can’t possibly be doing any real work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, this really grinds my gears, because I actively try to cultivate a persona that runs counter to the absurd notion that happiness and productivity are somehow mutually exclusive. Here are some hard truths of my life of which I’m frankly not ashamed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;(1) Grad School Isn't Miserable&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and I’m tired of everyone acting like it is. I get that this varies a lot advisor-to-advisor and person-to-person, but frankly it’s pretty damn awesome for me. When people say “oh well you just started,” or “just wait it gets horrible,” I want to yell. What kind of attitude is that? Why would I embark on this journey with that sort of endorsement? What do you, fellow grad student, gain from telling me about my future misery? Why are you so fussed when I refuse to commiserate?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I worked for three years before coming back to grad school, and I think that’s made all the difference for me. I spent a lot of time honing what I was truly interested in, exploring different research avenues and possibilities, and deciding what programs were and were not right for me. I gained valuable work skills such as managing long-term projects and working with diverse teams and doing my laundry even though I just worked for 14 hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, mostly, I prepped for the PhD. I read the books and did my homework on what a PhD means and does not mean, I talked to friends and friends-of-friends, and I feel like I jumped in clear-eyed about what’s to come. I’ll joke about my self-perceived ability and tangling up my self-worth with my scientific achievements, but you will never catch me without a glint in my eye that I get to do this every day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am having fun, and you can’t stop me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;(2) I'm Most Productive When I'm Happiest&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and honestly, you probably are, too. Because, as it turns out, happy people are more productive. I mean, for the love of god, look at the data! I don’t need to read these to tell you why I am more productive when I’m happy, cause I just feel it for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am extremely socially externally motivated, so if I’m doing work for someone I respect and I feel supports me, I am extremely interested in doing a lot for that person. I am also very excited to come into a lab where I like and respect the people around me. As it turns out, having fun with people promotes bonding, and consequently, respecting your lab mates. So, when we, as a lab, head off on a weekend trip, or Thursday-night-pints, or lab lunches (personally funded), all it shows is we genuinely enjoy spending time with each other. Is this a good time for #sorrynotsorry?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By contrast, when I am unhappy, almost nothing motivates me. I am extremely fortunate to be in consistently good-to-very-good mental health, cause if that were not the case I would get nothing done. On the rare occasion I’m feeling blue, I can barely open an email let alone do my actual job. I accomplish things because I feel supported, encouraged, and empowered to pursue my own intellectual development, under the guidance of my advisor, my lab, and my department.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I Hate the Capitalist Dystopia in which Happiness and Productivity are Mutually Exclusive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;(3) Grad School Is a Multi-Faceted Experience&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it turns out, the majority of my time at work isn’t spent doing “science,” but instead the vast amount of other things that fall under the job description of PhD Student.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On any given day I may be asked to: analyze data, write a paper, apply for workshops and grants, organize conferences, run trainings, present at metascience meetings, run department social media, organize grad student social events, organize lab social events, brainstorm and design and pilot new experiments, run participants, evangelize the field, work on student or department committees, speak to the public about the research, write for a public-facing journal or blog, or any number of the other myriad things that academia kind of just takes for granted that grad students just do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I love that! One of my favorite things about my work is how varied it is from day to day. I love the variety, and I love broadcasting that variety, too. I’m excited to share that being a “scientist,” isn’t a just solitary experience crunching numbers and fretting about equations and code that doesn’t compile, but about being a part of a scientific community. I love variety, I love collaboration, and I love showing people the great deal of fun associated with those things. Because…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;(4) Science is for Everyone&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and I want to make that clear. “Science,” and “Academia,” should be accessible to everybody who wants in, and who wants those things when they’re branded as soul-sucking wastes of time? I am proud to cultivate the persona of the happy scientist, who’s genuinely excited by her research, and absolutely jazzed every single day to work on HUMAN SOCIAL COGNITION, LIKE BUT ALSO THERE ARE ROBOTS!?!?!?! Like, whaaaaaaaat!? That IS awesome and I’m not about to tell you it isn’t!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I’m gonna portray that happiness and show you a face of science you might not be used to. I’m going to be unabashedly gleeful, unashamedly proud of my failures and successes, shamelessly curious, brazenly animated about the “work,” that I do every day, and tirelessly, relentlessly, continuously positive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Don't temper happiness to fit society's idea of productivity.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let work speak for itself. Write papers, run experiments, organize guest speakers, present to the department, be a TA, build social bonds, evangelize the school, do the dang job, then talk to me about productivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For now, just know it’s cool to be happy while you work.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Carolyn Saund</name><email>carolyn.saund@gmail.com</email></author><category term="happiness" /><category term="academia" /><category term="productivity" /><summary type="html">In the past, I’ve been accused of having “too much fun,” at work.

From terminal commands to touchpads, and text to voice interfaces, consumer electronics industries understand that ease-of-use is of the utmost importance to customers. The ultimate evolution of this idea is a frictionless Brain-Computer Interface (BCI).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These interfaces envisage a seductively convenient future: Machines that turn ideas to fully formed papers, gadgets that download memories so you never forget memories so you never forget, implanted devices for a wide array of medical conditions. With such tremendous possibility to break into the tech marketplace, a number of companies are working to make this dream a reality, and they’re getting lots of money for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While French gaming company NextMind tries to let users control video games with their $5M disclosed funding, medical device companies like Kernel and MindMaze have raised upwards of $100M to realize dreams of memory extension and neurorehabilitation through Neural Interfaces. Californian NeuroPace has gotten over $200M for their implant that responds to neurological activity. And, despite being intensely secretive, NeuraLink has raised over $27M for claiming to one day provide “super-human cognition.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These companies make assertions about their products based on sound research. Scientists showed humans are able to control interfaces on screens and even prosthetics using only their mind as early as 1991. Neurostimulation has shown to have profound effects on the ability to perceive empathy and boost cognition. We have even visualized memories based solely on brain activity. This shows significant scientific progress in the field of BCI, but is that enough for these companies to succeed?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Going from a Proof-of-Concept to a product is a perilous journey. Looking at the field of social robotics, there are troubling comparisons, as demonstrated by the rise and fall of Jibo, Aido, Miro, Anki, and all your other two-syllable-end-vowel robotics companies. These companies were based on research from MIT, Oxford, and Harvard that said social robots are socially desirable and medically helpful. They managed to raise staggering amounts of money, often in the realm of $100M or more. They were run by charismatic, successful serial-entrepreneurs. But ultimately, these robotics companies were built on future bets founded on the premise that we have technologies which we just do not yet have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The magic of BCI, like that of robots, captures the popular imagination. It’s important that someone dreams big and looks to the future – pulls the popular zeitgeist towards the presently-impossible but theoretically-plausible. Going from unimaginable to imagined is no small feat, and these companies are filling and important role in that regard. But, as usual when non-experts are confronted with dramatic future visions, things are blown out of proportion too quickly. While BCIs show intriguing potential to transform future interactions with technology, until any company successfully brings a BCI product to market that consumers can purchase off-the-shelf, assertions of their immediate impact should be met with scepticism.

&lt;p&gt;“IMMORTALITY POSSIBLE? World’s’s first human head transplant successfully carried out,”
reads the headline of one of the top search results for “head transplant” (2).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This headline is a particularly egregious example of how research in neuroscience and psychology often leads the
general public to extrapolate wildly about the nature and possibilities of humanity. It is absolutely
necessary that we, as a cohesive scientific community, ensure the public understands what we
are and are not doing – what is and is not currently possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most people only read about 20% of the contents of an online article (1). While the goal of an
online journal is to get the most clicks on their articles, we need to ensure that the scientific
findings and interpretations being transmitted are accurate and not debased. Here are a few
excellent ways for scientists to convey their findings and debunk myths about their research to
the general public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Get involved in public outreach campaigns. In order to control the message being delivered,
researchers can be the ones who start conversations. When we initiate public discussions about
our research topics, we can manage misconceptions directly with the people we are
communicating with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Review the university press release. Although we cannot directly control how media outlets
publish our studies, we can ensure the source-of-truth of any scientific reporting is accurate.
Additionally, we often have more power within our own universities to correct errors or
misleading phrasing than with general consumer publications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create and publish guides for readers. We can write up FAQs about our research that are
easily understandable, and publish them in public domains, like researchers from
Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) did with their important study investigating mortality
after Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico (3). Filtering out jargon helps the general public gain an
intuition for what the findings mean, and how they can or cannot be interpreted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We, as scientists, are in extremely powerful positions as experts in our domains. Consequently,
we must also uphold our duty to ensure findings are properly reported, de-sensationalized, and
understood by a broad audience.&lt;/p&gt;

So, it always strikes me as odd that social roboticists seem to insist on “measuring,” social personality traits with surveys and personal reports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not here to crap all over qualitative research. Of course, people need to think they feel something in order to buy (or want) it. But, the market tends to show that consistency beats out initial reactions. Some items are instant successes, but others are slow burns, like the iPhone. People thought “why would I need another device that’s like a computer, but small?” Then, upon actually interacting with the device, we all* think “wow it sure is perfect to have another device that’s like a computer, but small!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that brings us to social robots — devices which people seem to want to want, but apparently actually don’t. Study after study, researchers ask “how does this make you feel?” They create surveys that ask questions like “how much would you like this robot to be in your home?” or “how much fun was this robot to interact with?” The thing is, and I say this with love in my heart, people are dumb. As much as all the marketing majors are going to fist-bump their bros when I say this, it’s true: People don’t know what they want. And, people will always show you what they want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The way to see if people think something is creepy isn’t to ask them — though many will volunteer their opinion — but to watch them. Regardless of how they think they feel, what are their interactions like? Here is a short list of questions I think researchers oughta be measuring when it comes to human-robot social interaction:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How physically close do they get to the robot?&lt;br /&gt;
How does their face change when it does something surprising, or worrying, or cute?&lt;br /&gt;
How much do they try to help it when it’s stuck, or perceived to be broken?&lt;br /&gt;
How often do they choose to interact with it unsolicited?&lt;br /&gt;
How long do interactions last when the robot solicits them?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, when we social roboticists design systems and test hypothesis to make robots more fun, engaging, interactive, kind, insert-your-own-subjective-adjective-here, what we must do to evaluate our work is find behavioral proxies to measure our internal inferences. Yes, we are forced to assume “the kid thinks it’s more fun, because the kid played with it for longer, more frequently.” But I’d rather explicitize that assumption than rely on questionable self-reported data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, evaluating social robots is hard. It’s tough to recreate natural social situations in the lab, or even capture them to analyze in the home. But without observing real people really interacting with real robots, we’ll never get to the heart of what makes a robot… human.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Carolyn Saund</name><email>carolyn.saund@gmail.com</email></author><category term="tech" /><category term="software" /><category term="robotics" /><category term="UX" /><summary type="html">Humans are notoriously bad at self-reporting everything about ourselves, from our nutritional habits to sleep patterns.

I have worked in and (plan to, remember, just started) study machine learning for social and emotional interactions in robots. I’ve experimented with many ways to introduce this topic: “emotional intelligence, but for robots,” “social robotics,” “machine learning for robotic emotions.” Try as I might, I always get some flavor of this response:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, so you’re the one destroying the future?
To which I roll my eyes. Hard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That being said, I get why people have that response. I think about technology all day, every day. I’ve worked in industry, and researched in academia. Although I am young, I am one of relatively few people in the world who specializes in social interactions of robots (although it’s a quickly growing field). Not everybody’s life revolves day-in, day-out around the future of technology, so of course I do not expect everybody to think as much about these topics as I do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is why I so, so often find media coverage of emerging technology anywhere from disappointingly misleading, to downright enraging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although there are many examples of such articles, I write this as a specific response to a 2014 youtube video which I’ve had the pleasure of viewing a number of times, and was recently used by somebody to justify their criticism of my entire career. After watching this video, it’s no wonder the average intelligent human I come across is nervous about the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this piece I hope to explain both how to spot fear-mongering tactics with media coverage of technology, and why the “robot revolution,” is, in fact, nothing to fear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I am NOT saying is “don’t think about the future.” Absolutely DO think about the future. Often! And, don’t be scared of it. Let me tell you why you should be excited!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will come to you in three parts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Act I: The Video
Act II: Fear Mongering and Deception
Act III: The Progress of Humanity&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;act-i-the-video&quot;&gt;Act I: The Video&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grey begins with a fairly standard historical introduction of automation. The basic arguments one uses to assuage the fears of grandma at Thanksgiving, or crazy uncle Pete, who did the 60s a little too hard:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Replacing human labor with mechanical muscles frees people to specialize, and that leaves everyone better off, even those still doing physical labor.”
With this, I whole-heartedly agree. Because we look at history, and it’s always been true. “Luddite,” became a word in the english vocabulary because radical english textile workers felt their jobs were threatened by automation… and now we have more fashion designers, specialty embroiderers, and fabric choice than ever before. Historically, new technologies haven’t gotten rid of jobs, but created all new ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, quickly after making this point, Grey states his thesis of the video: “This time, it’s different.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;low-skilled-bots&quot;&gt;Low-Skilled Bots&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;industry-bots&quot;&gt;Industry Bots&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grey starts by introducing Baxter with an annoyingly optimistic reading on its capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Baxter can learn what you want him to do by watching you do it, and he costs less than the annual average salary of a human worker… he can do whatever work is within the reach of his arms.”
What Grey fails to mention here are the extreme limitations within which Baxter can learn. One-shot learning is very much still not-a-thing in mechanical robotics, and robots even understanding where and how they can move their appendages is an active area of research… that doesn’t exactly look sexy (well, not to me). Path-planning for how to move a robotic arm from point A to point B is not a solved problem. Humans, on the other hand, can actually do what Grey shows in the video: watch a human perform an object manipulation, and repeat, instantly, infinitely, with many micro-differences in orientations, sizes, and shapes of the object. Baxter, straight up, can’t do that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, Baxter lacks a key element of human workers: the ability to interact socially. There are entire fields of research dedicated to the many ways in which social ability improves the quality of interactions between humans and machines, which Baxter does not and likely will not ever have. This includes the ability to read the emotion of the teacher, which is an invaluable skill that human workers have in abundance. “Are they angry at me?” → “Did I just mess up in a way that is serious, and I should try to fix through iteration?”; “Are they afraid?” → “Did I just do something potentially dangerous, that I should avoid again at all costs?” While Baxter can watch and attempt to imitate, the word “learn” implies a level of ability that robots, right now, simply do not have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My issue here is that Grey repeatedly pounds home the point that robots are now, when, in reality, with these two problems above plus many others which I fail to mention, I’d say that optimistically, robots are, maybe, 25 years from now. Rodney Brooks, “the father of AI,” happens to think it’s much further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grey also brings up how incredibly cheap robotic labor is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“His hourly cost is pennies of electricity, while his meat-based competition costs minimum wage.”
Indeed, this is true. Once Baxter is up and running (built, installed, and trained by a human, thankyouverymuch).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or is it? For reference, the federal minimum wage in the United States is $7.25/hr. Ignoring the fact that this is reprehensibly and appallingly low, this gives us a base salary of just over $15k/year for a minimum wage worker. Baxter’s monumental startup cost, on the other hand, is $22k, which includes only a 1-year warranty of manual fixes and software upgrades (you can get an extended 3-year warranty for an additional fee). While I find Rethink Robotics to be a great, honest, and awesome company, they’re still a company, and they exist to make money. So after that first year, software upgrades cost money. Tesla, for example, charges $9000 for a software update, and that’s for a consumer product (which will always be less money than for a corporate deal, because companies have more money than people).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And why do you think an extended warranty costs extra? It’s because robots break. And high-use and high-precision robots break often. And you don’t know how to fix them, so they cost money to fix. A lot of money, because a highly-skilled human has to come in and fix them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bottom line: we are nowhere near automating even “teachable” low-skill jobs. And when it looks like we are, look closer: the cost for robots is often much, much higher than you think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;hospitality-bots&quot;&gt;Hospitality Bots&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grey goes on to target hospitality workers and describe how robots are “coming for them,” by using two target examples: self-checkout machines, and barista-bots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first example I find absolutely laughable; self-checkout machines used to be 30 humans, yet somehow we haven’t seen huge unemployment among the grocery-worker industry. I literally don’t even know how to dignify this example with a response; nobody liked bagging groceries, grocery clerks and baggers still exist, and by far the biggest challenge to those working in grocery stores have been their human managers trying to screw them over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, let’s talk about baristas, I guess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, when was the last time you saw a robot barista? It was probably memorable, because there are hardly any of them. If you want to count automated coffee machines, your instances go way up, sure, but we also have free water fountains literally legally required everywhere. So let’s focus on fancy beverages: they’re hard to make, and the reason they haven’t taken over is because they are not cost effective. Coffee shops generally operate under two models: make a lot of it, cheaply, and quickly, or make a little of it, extremely carefully, and charge a boat load. For the former, It’s cheaper to pay Bobby-the-part-time-student to make your latte than it is to buy a $30k robot when you already spent $50k for a franchise license. For the latter, obviously a robot could never have the same touch as Alphonso, your reigning in-house latte-making champion of Florence for five years running.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grey then employs what I can only describe as an annoyingly misleading tactic of fear-mongering and say “this robot is actually a giant network of robots that remembers who you are and how you like your coffee.” Almost everything we interact with on a daily basis is a network of machines (hot tip, you can sub out the word machine for robot any time you like! It doesn’t always work in both directions, though, so be careful). Reading this on an internet browser, you’re probably being served information from thousands of different machines in locations around the world. I will save my rant about “the Cloud” for another time, but by emphasizing that one machine is actually many machines incorrectly paints a picture that everywhere we interact with a machine, there are dozens more just lurking in the background. In reality, nearly every interface for humans is built with a complete pipeline in mind, and can be treated as a single unit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-horses&quot;&gt;The Horses&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One analogy that I actually simply adore in this video is Grey’s Horse comparison. He asks viewers to imagine being a horse before the automobile revolution. “Surely, there will still be jobs,” one horse says to another, and then goes on to point out how horses have “become obsolete,” and “have no work to do.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He then points out that a rule of “Better technology makes more better jobs for horses,” sounds silly, but “when we replace ‘horses’ with ‘humans’ and suddenly people think it sounds about right.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, yes, actually, we do and absolutely should expect that to be true. Because we, as humans, optimize society, culture, economics, and life to be human-centric… not horse-centric. The reason “better technology makes more better jobs for humans,” can be thought of as true is because humans control technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And as for the horses… horseback riding is now a leisure activity, and the vast majority of horses now have a substantially higher quality of life than before being abused by farm workers. Similarly, human working and living conditions have only gotten better since humans have been required to do less hard labor and made more money for less dying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He conveniently ignores this while he points out “horses have been on the decline ever since,” and to that I say: indeed. Because humans are in charge of breeding horses, and horses are tools for humans. Similarly, computers, machines, and robots are tools for humans. Humans are in control of technology, and always will be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;transportation&quot;&gt;Transportation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About four years ago, I made a bet with my dad that on my 30th birthday, we wouldn’t be able to get into a self-driving car and have it take us to a fancy seafood restaurant. We get into that car, I pay for dinner. Any human plays a role in our navigation and transportation there, he pays. I still feel confident about my bet, and I still have a few years to go. Which is why I laughed out loud when I heard Grey say, four years ago…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Self-driving cars aren’t they future. They’re here and they work.”
Let me explain. “Here,” to me, would mean companies are actually using self-driving cars to automate-out jobs. Despite startups and attempts, this is still not true. So… they’re not “here,” and they especially weren’t “here,” four years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, I agree, as Grey points out, self-driving vehicles are substantially — one might even say alarmingly — safer than human drivers, so they will, and more importantly absolutely should eventually replace human drivers. See the end of this article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One solution Grey glosses over is “pushing 100 million additional people through higher education,” but as it turns out, you don’t need to complete higher education to have a high-skilled job. The American-centric vision of education-as-a-must-for-good-work is, as far as I can tell, exclusively American. Many other countries commonly institute apprenticeships for students as young as 15 (France and Germany come to mind), and in my personal experience, no other country looks down so much on highly skilled trade work, such as plumbing or electrician workers — both of which there are currently zero attempts (that I’m aware of) to automate using robotics. Grey, don’t be so educationally elitist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;professional-bots&quot;&gt;Professional Bots&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One fun-unknown-fact that machine learning scientists love to bring up is the task of “discovery.” “Discovery,” basically means sifting through mountains and mountains of documents for your field (law, if you’re a lawyer; medicine, if you’re a doctor) and finding correlations, anomalies, relevant articles, and other patterns from dense, obfuscated information. Doctors used to have to spend hundreds of hours sifting through research that wasn’t relevant to find one line that might be worthwhile for a particular patient’s case, and for the most part, that was time wasted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I’m deeply confused by Grey’s attempt to make it sound like a bad thing that humans no longer have to do that. Highly skilled, highly trained people get to spend more time doing the thing that they are highly skilled and trained for… I truly fail to see the detriment to humanity here. It’s not like those people are losing their jobs — discovery is only one small part of being a highly-skilled worker, and often the worst, most tedious part at that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the topic of doctors, he says&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Doctor bots keep track of everything worldwide, and make correlations that would be impossible to find otherwise.”
Uhh… yes? Here, he brings up a doctor-bot that “gives guidance on lung-cancer treatments.” The key word here is guidance. If I were a doctor charged with saving a person’s life, for fuck’s sake I would absolutely want every possible tool available to me to save that person’s life. And, as the doctor, I would retain responsibility for that life. It’s not as if we are handing over our well-beings to robots and telling the doctors to shut up and get out. Quite the opposite, we are empowering doctors to make better decisions for their patients. How, exactly, is it a bad thing that doctors are getting better tools to — let me say it again — SAVE HUMAN LIVES?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And why does he think this will lead to doctors becoming obsolete?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Not all doctors will go away, but when doctor bots are comparable to humans and as close as your phone, the need for general doctors will be less.”
Yes, so for once maybe it’s a good thing every western nation has a shortage of doctors, and developing nations have an extreme shortage. Maybe we’ll fill that, and more people will be able to get reliable healthcare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this is not exactly a new issue. Every time I visit the doctor, it’s already because technology hasn’t given me the answer. Nobody(ish) doesn’t google their symptoms and try to self-diagnose or self-treat. With more accurate home-diagnoses, this will allow humans to self-diagnose and self-treat more safely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;creative-bots&quot;&gt;Creative Bots&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next angle to assess is the idea that computers might begin to produce art or other creative works which rival human ability, and to that I simply say, perhaps! As a member of multiple artistic programming communities, I holistically advocate for use of new technologies, including deep learning techniques which Grey seems to find so “terrifying,” to produce new types of art. Because machines and machine learning is now just another tool for artistic expression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, art is produced by humans, for humans. Art that is not valuable in some way to humans is worthless, and therefore I just absolutely cannot see a future in which artists are displaced because machines are practicing their craft “better,” then them. And further, it is important to remember that art that might have been strictly produced by a machine holding a paintbrush or writing music, was actually produced by a human: the programmer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The argument that computers will replace art and creativity seems in this video to be succinctly summed up by…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“People used to think playing chess was a uniquely human thing to do… right up until the point that computers beat the best of us.”
(Quick aside, chess is a remarkably misleading comparison to make in a section entitled “creative bots,” because chess is one of the easiest things to get a computer to do well — it has extremely precise and specific rules, known strategies, and requires highly-branching simulations of permutations of these known rules… quite, quite unlike art. But still, even if we lend him this comparison…)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet people still play chess for fun. Just as people will continue to paint, draw, compose, write, and create, for their passion. And while “we can’t have a poem and painting-based economy,” art produced by humans will always be valuable at a bare minimum because it was produced by humans. Because it’s art, and it has the value we place on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This video creates a false sense of urgency about an economic and social chaos that isn’t here… and isn’t coming. The hype around computers — and in particular, that one special word, robots — is overblown at best, and utterly unfounded at worst. And it is also, unfortunately, ubiquitous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I get it, not everybody is as intimately aware of the abundance of problems that machine learning, robotics, and AI researchers deal with as I am. From robotic arm movements, manufacturing techniques, camera exposure, voice production, conversational interfaces, safety measures, movement and navigation, weather conditions, task-specific knowledge, contextualization, action learning, or any number of the other hundreds of active research areas, the obstacles to machines even getting close to wholesale replacing human labor are vast and complicated. But when you hear authorities go on a rant like this, it can make all those problems seem… solved. They’re really not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what was the purpose of this video?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This video isn’t about how automation is bad, rather, how automation is inevitable.”
Dude, give me a break. I just explained all the ways automation isn’t inevitable, and I didn’t even get into my own field (social and emotional robotics — if you think movement is hard, try psychology).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But am I just just being defensive? Do I just “want to reject it,” as Grey suggests? Is my interpretation that this surely must exist exclusively to scare people into being Luddites unfounded?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s go ahead and reach back to high school literature class brains and do some tone analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;fear-mongering-and-deception&quot;&gt;Fear Mongering and Deception&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not-Fun Fact: 3 out of the last 10 people I told I work in robotics said “oh so like terminator?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When people tell you they’re not trying to scare you, they’re probably trying to scare you.
This video de-personalizes humans at nearly every turn, referring to people as “meat-based counterparts,” to machines — simultaneously de-humanizing the human, and putting our silicon-based counterparts directly in our seats. While referring to humans as “meat,” is cheeky within the field (my personal favorite term is actually “squishy,”) doing so outside, to the average media consumer, naturally evokes images of being consumed, eaten, devoured. Especially coupled with Grey’s ascription of human-y he-series pronouns to Baxter, calling humans “meat,” in a video that is clearly designed to scare people away from robots purposely puts people in a defensive position, in which they must defend themselves from slaughter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think that sounds dramatic? Take a look at the violent imagery used throughout the video. At Jeopardy, Watson doesn’t simply out-perform or even “beat,” the competition, but “crushes,” humans. Much more violent, much more dramatic. At performing sheer volumes of tasks, automated machines don’t simply out-produce or work longer and more consistently, but “destroy,” human performance. He describes their current role in the economy as “terrifying.” Make no mistake, these are deliberate attempts to get humans to imagine heartless, tyrannical overlords that are purposefully and intentionally causing real, physical harm to humans. Again, conveniently ignoring the fact that machines are produced by humans, for humans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then there’s the entire over-arching horse analogy. Not only does Grey again compare humans to animals, but tools, subtly implying that humans will become the obsolete tools of computers, instead of viewing computers and machines as what they are: yet another tool created to advance human progress. The thing about this analogy is it’s so easy to switch a few things around, and suddenly it looks like a much less scary and more accurate picture of reality: Instead of the human being the horse, the computer is the automobile. With the automobile, horse labor became obsolete, as did a whole host of jobs associated with caring for and working with horses, which ultimately enabled humans to have more time working in other fields (sometimes literally), or simply have more leisure time. The automobile enabled whole new hosts of job categories (like that whole transportation thing that we managed to live without for the first 3000 years of modern economic systems). The automobile was a tool of human progress, and there is no reason why computers, again, built by humans for humans, will not follow a similar path.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a number of times in which he makes it clear that humans and computers are in direct competition:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Mechanical minds will push humans out of the economy”
“Robots are already beating humans…”
But as I’ve said many times, this is a false equivalency. Humans and computers are simply not in competition. Computers are, always have been, and always will be, designed to have purposes that are ultimately useful to humans. Humans are useful to other humans by virtue of the fact that we are social beings that can never be replaced by machines. Just as there was no competition between humans and horses to pull carriages, computers will automate-away tedious and laborious tasks that humans don’t want to or simply cannot do. Computers will do jobs that, sure, perhaps humans could do, but really rather not. And, truth be told, I just don’t see a problem with that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another tactic used in this video is showing misleading, irrelevant, or confusing footage and images throughout intense and aforementioned scary voiceovers. Showing footage of Atlas, the bipedal Boston Dynamics robot, for example, is simply ridiculously misleading. Yes, they have a very impressive demo reel. But Atlas also fell over just after a demo. Robots can be described as finicky, temperamental, incredibly frustrating, or just fucking hard. And every time somebody shows you an incredibly impressive demo — particularly of the big, scary Boston Dynamics bots — just remember it likely took at least one hundred takes to get something remotely usable, that is probably also heavily edited. This isn’t to say the field isn’t advancing, it’s to say showing a video and proclaiming it as the current standard when it absolutely is not and will not be for the foreseeable future for known and easily googleable reasons is plain irresponsible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a similar vein, showing a deep learning neural net and some math equations and implying that can solve any problem that a human worker can solve is straight-up ridiculous. When the majority of people don’t understand deep learning or how it works, and many feel a vague anxiety or fear around mathematics, and humans in general feel uncomfortable with the unknown, it is fear-mongering, plain and simple, to quickly show people a math equation, tell them it’s evil, and move on. To do it twice, with the same image, is just lazy video editing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, with this apocalyptic tone, it’s no wonder Grey sets us up at the end, saying&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I know this is a lot to take in, and you might want to reject it, but…”
Well, that’s just a frustrating tactic. Of course I want to reject it… you’ve spent 13 minutes telling me in no subtle way that life as I know it is completely over, and exclusively computers are to blame. Anybody who isn’t thinking critically and one-by-one picking apart these arguments will of course be convinced, because people respond emotionally to emotional words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These tactics are unfortunately not unique to this video. They are used heavily throughout media coverage of emerging and advancing technologies, and it is important that the research community is extremely careful to spot and call them out, as well as avoid unintentionally using them ourselves (alright, alright! I’ll stop calling humans “squishy robots”). As for the average media consumer, I encourage each and every single person to think critically about not only the content, but the tone of what you consume. Some questions you can ask yourself to spot fear-mongering tactics are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How am I feeling while listening to this? Do I feel threatened, or relaxed?
What sort of concerns do I have about the topic being presented?
Who is the author of this piece, and what are their affiliations?
Now, as for the particular topic of this video, let me explain why a heavily computerized workforce is actually an incredibly exciting opportunity and amazing advancement for humanity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-progress-of-humanity&quot;&gt;The Progress of Humanity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;over-abundance-isnt-a-bad-thing&quot;&gt;Over-Abundance Isn’t A Bad Thing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a number of proposals that do anticipate widespread automation and consequential unemployment (which, to be clear, I do not believe will happen).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, there exists a future in which humans live in such abundance that we straight-up don’t need to work. Finland recently ended a universal basic-income (UBI) trial after two-years, with inconclusive — not negative! — results. Many celebrities espouse the benefits of UBI, and specific townships which have tried it have experienced positive results. Hamilton, Canada, for example, is currently participating in a 3-year UBI experiment, with citizens proclaiming:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Basic income has given me freedom to live with some dignity with a little extra money to buy the essentials in life”
And for those worried about the economic stagnation of such situations:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Some experiments have even found that basic income increases entrepreneurship, which would ultimately lead to more employment down the road. The truth is that most people want to contribute to society. If we can provide them with basic financial security, they’ll find a way to do it.”
Even all that aside, economies don’t necessarily need to grow to be healthy, and reinforcing the notion that they do perpetuates what is, in my opinion, a dangerously ruthless and narrow instantiation of capitalism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, in the best case scenario, we, as a society, get our heads out of our own asses and understand that maybe not every single human needs to work for us to all coexist peacefully and comfortably, sharing this big blue rock we know and love. I understand that sounds like a socialist utopia, so let’s just go through all the amazing concrete things that actually are happening now, thanks to the robotics revolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;improving-quality-of-life-for-neglected-populations&quot;&gt;Improving Quality of Life For Neglected Populations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Persons with disabilities (including the veteran in the photo above) arguably have the most to gain from a techno-revolution. While most developed nations are better about treating persons with non-standard abilities as real humans, the U.S. is pretty trash at it. From robotic walkers to aid in lower-limb rehabilitation, to applications that help healthcare providers monitor depression, to literally any of the hundreds of robots and devices designed to deliver and improve care to underserved populations, the robotic revolution is seen as an exclusive positive for many whose life, up until this point, we just haven’t valued like we should.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Social robots provide companionship to depressed seniors, who, when surveyed, report significantly lower loneliness which can help the elderly live longer with robotic companions. This isn’t taking jobs away from elderly-care workers, this is filling a niche which we, as a society, have currently left wide open. It’s not as if robots will suddenly replace grandkids visiting grandma at the home, or even at her house — it’s that we’re just shitty to our elderly people. Robots, especially sweet, cuddly, friendly ones, can straight-up improve the quality of life for this oft-neglected and significant portion of our population.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, advancements in technology can lead to overall better care for persons who need significant monitoring. Many emerging systems are starting to come on the market to help under-staffed, over-worked nursing-home workers with monitoring their patients, which leads to improvements in nursing home care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Robots and new technologies also help non-neurotypical individuals navigate the world. Rosalind Picard, who coined the term and started the field of Affective Computing, designed glasses to help children with autism understand emotions of those around them. This field also helped create a seizure-detecting bracelet to help alert caregivers when individuals experience convulsive seizures. Both of these things would not be possible without serious advances in machine learning and robotic technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;saving-human-lives&quot;&gt;Saving Human Lives&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On transportation, Grey says:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“These jobs are over.”
Well, some of them, yes. And as a result, 32,000 people won’t be killed in car accidents each year. Hundreds of thousands will be spared the injury and pain of being in, or having a loved one be involved in, car accidents. Families will not be made bankrupt by the financial burden of having to pay for chronic injuries as a result of car accidents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Food will be delivered faster, and prices will go down. Less will be wasted by rotting in transit. More people will get more nutritious food.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And besides, as I’ve stated above, technological advancements will eventually have entirely self-driving systems, but most companies are currently investigating hybrid models that will still require human intervention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But ultimately, are transportation industry jobs more important than human lives?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the fear that bots will make doctors obsolete, well, I cannot stress enough how untrue that is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is currently a shortage of doctors that disproportionately affects developing nations. With self-diagnosing tools and automated recommendations, more people, across more area, will have access to accurate, reliable healthcare, that simply do not have it right now. These are not jobs that are being taken away, but again, an unfulfilled niche that we, as a global society, have left empty. This is exclusively providing more to people who have less, not even taking and distributing resources, but just allowing people with less to have more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not to mention all the other great social-justicy things about robotic decision making, including the potential to reduce human biases in police and miedical work, and consequently alleviate racial and class divides, which I won’t elaborate on here because that’s a complex topic that I honestly have to give more thought towards before I espouse its virtues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, what I find so frustrating is the way so much media coverage simply glosses over how many human lives will and are being saved by emerging technologies. And even though some jobs are going to start being done by computers (again, still hasn’t happened, it’s not “here,” yet), economic growth is not more important than human lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Say it with me now: economic growth is not more important than human lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;get-excited&quot;&gt;Get Excited!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are so many more exciting applications and implications of new technologies that I didn’t even start to cover here. Augmented and virtual reality video games, personalized security systems, decreasing food and shelter prices, bias-detection… just about every aspect of human life does have the potential to be impacted by computers. The limit really is the human imagination, and the way humans choose to put these applications into practice. Humans absolutely should be thinking about the future, and how we can use technology to make positive impacts in our local, personal, disenfranchised, developing, underserved, and global communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I’ve made it clear I don’t think the robot revolution is here, it is coming — albeit slowly — and that’s a good thing. Remember, technology has always provided humans with more: more time, more money, more food, more connection, more buying power, more comfort, more, more, more. Not only do we not have to be scared of computers “coming for our jobs,” but we should be actively brainstorming how we can use computers to make our lives easier. Indeed, how could I make a robot do my job? And, as it turns out, if your job involves any amount of moving around, being in close proximity to other humans, social interaction including conversation, contextualized knowledge, or creative interpretation, sorry, but you’re probably gonna have to keep working at that job awhile longer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if anybody comes up with a way to automate cognitive emotional robotics research, let me know.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Carolyn Saund</name><email>carolyn.saund@gmail.com</email></author><category term="robotics" /><category term="futurism" /><category term="technology" /><summary type="html">As a new PhD student, starting at a new university, in a new city, in a new country, I’ve found myself introducing my work to many new people lately. I have worked in and (plan to, remember, just started) study machine learning for social and emotional interactions in robots. I’ve experimented with many ways to introduce this topic: “emotional intelligence, but for robots,” “social robotics,” “machine learning for robotic emotions.” Try as I might, I always get some flavor of this response:</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Concrete Examples.</title><link href="https://csaund.github.io/posts/2018/01/concrete-examples/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Concrete Examples." /><published>2018-01-28T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2018-01-28T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://csaund.github.io/posts/2018/01/blog-post-8</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://csaund.github.io/posts/2018/01/concrete-examples/">&lt;h2 id=&quot;women-are-socialized-to&quot;&gt;“Women are socialized to…”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve had many friends basically say they don’t believe “women are raised to…” and use this skepticism to put the burden of gender inequality on women. Here are some concrete examples I can think of that support the idea that, currently, women are brought up in society to…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;be-quiet&quot;&gt;“Be quiet.”&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was actively reprimanded for speaking too much in class — in every single year from 3rd grade on, my teacher eventually condemned me to “two comments per class” to give others a chance to speak. I see this as a delightful gift that has endued me with empathy and a holistic, team-oriented perspective, but I also have been given feedback now, professionally, that I am not aggressive and not self-serving enough to get ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also remember the onslaught of stupid, annoying boys who continuously spoke out-of-turn in class. One particularly memorable episode was my first and only detention, in which, during a math test, our teacher kept yelling to stop whispering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I agree, Ms. Whatsherface, shut the fuck up you stupid idiot boys. Whispering intensifies. She looks annoyed but turns to whatever she’s doing at her desk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After I finished the test (first, bitch!) I went back to my desk to read, when Stenn turned to me, “hey, how do you do problem 3?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“SHHHH” our teacher growls, without looking up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I glare at Stenn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Come on, I know you know how to do it. You’re so smart” he smiles, cause he’s cute, and thinks that will somehow get me to yield to his dumb face.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The next person to talks gets a detention,” teacher says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I glare harder, and look at the teacher, trying to get her attention to point out he’s talking to me. She still doesn’t look up. I quietly and completely lose respect for this scumbag human.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Please?” Stenn begs. He moves his pencil towards me. He scoots his chair towards me. Who does this punk think he is? I haven’t even hit puberty and he’s acting like he’s seducing me in the way 5th graders do. You’re not Leonardo DiCaprio, back up, poo-face. He’s relentless, though, and keeps making whispery noises at me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Stop talking to me!” I eventually whisper, as quietly, but forcefully, as I could.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“CAROLYN! DETENTION!” She yells.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I was telling him to stop talking to me!” I exclaim, going full-volume now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“She was! I promise! It was me!” Stenn admits. As an aside, this actually makes me like him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Yeah, it’s true, we heard it, Stenn was whispering to her and she just told him to stop talking,” the two other students who share our table pipe up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Alright? Well then, looks like you all get detention!” Whakka-whakka-whaaaat? Yes, that’s right. Not only did I get in trouble for daring to tell someone else to stop breaking the rules, and stop bringing me into it, but everybody who stood up for me was also punished.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, what about the detentions for all the annoying-ass stupid boys that started whispering in the first place? They broke the rules all the time, and got punished for it maybe 1/10 times it bothered the fuck out of me. What about giving them detention for their chorus of “ooooooooo,” as she wrote up the citation? What about punishing the people who were actually causing the problem, instead of me, who was obviously and clearly and demonstrably trying to stop it? Nada.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;yield-to-others-wishes&quot;&gt;“Yield to others’ wishes.”&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was in preschool, I had a friend named Kayla. Kayla was, and is to this day, just about the sweetest girl that has ever existed. She is kind and thoughtful and adventurous and by all metrics a great friend to have for a three-year-old to eat sand with. But I was a little bitch-demon of a babe and so when Kayla one day asked me “hey do you want to play with me?” I said “NO. I DON’T LIKE YOU.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kayla, understandably, started to cry. My mother saw this episode, and came over to me. “Carolyn, that’s not how we say no. That is mean. We think about her feelings.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe what my mother taught me to be true. That shouldn’t be how we communicate. I think we should take others’ feelings and perspectives into account, and communicate in ways that are clear and kind, to the extent we can. (I think this is pretty difficult for a three year old)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is significant, and has been told to me, because my pre-school teacher intervened. “No, Laura,” she said, “we actually want to teach them that no means no, and to be forceful when they feel ‘no’. When she’s a teenager, you’ll want her to feel comfortable saying ‘NO’ to boys.” For what it’s worth, I now have no problem saying No.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also have empathy and compassion for those for whom “no,” is a difficult word to assert.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me just say again, in pre-school, my teacher was thinking about how I would defend myself against the inevitable assault of men against my mind and body. My own mother, who is herself a strong, independently-minded, assertive, kind woman, didn’t realize teaching me to temper my “no,” could leave me vulnerable in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;put-others-first&quot;&gt;“Put others first.”&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I tried out for the school jazz band, and made it my sophomore year, I was pumped. As a life-long band-nerd, getting into the school’s highest musical ensemble was an accomplishment of which I was sincerely proud. But one boy, who I grew up playing next to, wasn’t as excited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You should give your spot to Kevin,” he said. “He tried really hard, and really wants to be in jazz. And he’s older than you.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I care why, exactly?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“But we both tried out and I made it in!” I already knew in my heart I wasn’t giving this punk my spot, but I was 15 and really wanted this guy to get it. It isn’t fair to ask me to cede my spot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Yeah, but, I mean, he’s also a boy, and if you joined you’d be the only girl.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s funny he said this, because this thought had literally not crossed my mind. It often still doesn’t, and only after I leave a space do I realize I was the only woman there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“… So?” Was my only response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I mean… you know…” he said. I didn’t know. I still don’t really know. I mean, I don’t get it, but when dudes want dude-only time, sure, that’s fine, I don’t get it because it seems like the vast majority of the existence of the world is dude-only time, but I can respect that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But at sixteen, this boy wanted me to give up something I really wanted, and had rightfully earned, because a boy had “tried hard,” and fit in with the group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sound familiar?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank goodness my pre-school teacher let me yell NO. Fuck hurting his feelings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;aim-low&quot;&gt;“Aim low.”&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My junior year of high school, I had the choice to take all AP classes, plus the hardest musical ensemble (plus some other extra-curriculars). My brother did this his junior year. He got into CalTech. I wanted to get into a good school. I also was tired of dealing with the bullshit that comes in public high school — side conversations, drama, dumb kids not paying attention or not caring. That shit drove me nuts. I was so excited to be in only AP classes and put that behind me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My guidance counselor said “I know this is what you want, but you have to understand, you’ve never been challenged, and this is going to be really hard for you.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Yeah, it’s fine, it’s what I want to do.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Don’t you want to do things outside of school?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Yeah, I’ll have time. I have thought about this and talked about it with my parents, I can do this, and I want to do this.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I really don’t think you will. You don’t understand how hard this is going to be.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I really think I do, and if I don’t, I’ll find out. It’s fine. Let me take the classes.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Okay… you know it’s okay to drop something if you get overwhelmed, right?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My area has problems with students committing suicide, presumably because of the pressure to overachieve. I have the great luxury of having no such pressure, or mental illness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I’m totally fine. You’ve known me for two years, you know I have no problem saying when I’m not fine. This will be fine.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I just feel really nervous letting you do all this.” Bitch, get off my back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Well, my brother did all this, and he worked hard and I saw it and it was fine for him, it will be fine for me.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Yes but you’re not your brother.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, cool, let’s count the ways I’m distinct from my brother at this stage in life:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both in top musical ensembles? Check.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both have straight-A records in the most difficult classes? Yup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both represent the school in California math competitions? Mhm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what exactly, Ms. Rodriguez, is your hesitation with me “pushing myself?” Why did I have to have three separate meetings and get parental permission to try exactly as hard as my brother did?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, only because I was maybe-ignorant, maybe-overly-forceful was I able to assert that my “yes, let me try” was as valid as his. Mom &amp;amp; Dad, you may give me shit about being stubborn and strong-willed to get what I want, but at least what I want is success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;act-dumb&quot;&gt;“Act dumb.”&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 7th grade, I cried when I got my report card. I cried because I had gotten a 4.0, and I didn’t want to be a nerd. I don’t know why exactly I cried, or what led to the crying, but I remember I cried and distinctly remember three different responses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cute boys in the class said “haha, you’re a nerd.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The girls in the class unfailingly said “wow you’re right, you are a nerd. You’ll never get a boyfriend like that. Sorry you’re so smart.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The smart boys in the class (who were not also cute) said “you crying is the dumbest thing I’ve ever seen. I’m mad at you, because you’re smarter than me.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m glad I remember this, because I could not make this up if I tried. I was crying as a child, before I had any control over my education or environment, when I had many strong female role models and equality demonstrated to me at home blah blah blah… because I already thought it was not only more important to have a boyfriend than to be smart, but because that was actively, consciously reinforced by my classmates. This, in rich, liberal, suburban California.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And all of these stereotypes hold. Even the smart girls agreed, sucks to be too smart. The smart boys resented me for being better than them. The cute boys, even the ones who were smart, thought that since I was smart, I couldn’t possibly also be worthy of being a girlfriend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SEVENTH. GRADE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;let-someone-else-be-in-charge&quot;&gt;“Let someone else be in charge.”&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also in 7th grade, in algebra class (for 8th graders, get on my level), we took tests as a group of four. I love this style of test-taking, because it encourages collaboration, teamwork, and a shared sense of belonging. It also demands confidence — “I know I’m right, so that’s the answer we’re putting down.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had been the de-facto leader in each test I had taken… most of the 7th graders had. My team always got As, not because I answered every problem correctly, but because I answered most of them, but when I wasn’t confident, I had no problem yielding to others who were more certain. My own test average probably would have been around a B+.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In one of the last tests of the year, I was in a group with three boys. When we got the exam, Casey said, “Alright I’m going to be Carolyn this time.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Uhh… what do you mean? I’m Carolyn.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I’m in charge of what we’re writing this time.” He stated, simply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“No you’re not. I am. I have been for all the other tests, and we’ve gotten all As. We’ll still listen to you, and you can even write it down, but I’ll decide what answers we put down.” Don’t you take this from me, Casey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“No. You’re always so bossy. Just give me a turn!” He whined. “Yeah,” the other boys said, “he’s right. You always get to be in charge. Just let him decide.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“No! You’re all getting Ds in this class and Ms. Weinstein literally put me in this group so you’d get an A on this test to bring up your grades! Let me decide!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Okay, so, problem 1… ” Casey began, utterly ignoring my completely logical rationale for me being in charge, that would certainly benefit him and his friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cue us spending the next 47 minutes with me saying “No, that’s wrong!” and them saying “Well we think it’s right so that’s what we’re doing” and me leading them through how to solve the problem and them saying “ugh shut up you’re so bossy. You always get to lead and you’re younger than us so it’s our turn.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We got a D on that test. Their stupidity and illogical need to drive despite my proven track record of success punished me and my grades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Carolyn! I thought you were supposed to be smart!” Casey giggled when we got our exams back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are you fucking kidding me?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ms. Weinstein, to her credit, saw the whole damn thing, and told our group we would have the option of taking an individual make-up test if we wanted to. None of the boys took that option — they didn’t care about their grades. I cared. I took the test, by myself. I got an A.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;in-conclusion&quot;&gt;In Conclusion…&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t know if these experiences are unique to me, but I have shared these stories quite a few times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The non-men all say, “yup, me too.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The men all say, “really?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeah… really. Yes, really. Yes. Yes. Really. Yes, these are my real experiences that I can really point to, and these are only the ones I remember.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you meet strong women, remember, we are often strong in spite of, not because of, our upbringing. Despite the strong mothers and teachers and volunteer mentors and uplifting men and role models of all genders, there is still work to be done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just believe it’s different for us than you. Just believe the universe looks different through our eyes.

Partially an exercise to aid writing 
my statement of purpose, maybe somebody else can solidify&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-field&quot;&gt;The Field&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;industry&quot;&gt;Industry&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a certain intellectual apathy. The emphasis on product is frustratingly limiting. Of course, 
I know grad school isn’t all rainbows and butterflies (it IS compromise that moves us along, after all [it’s a Maroon 5 joke.]) 
but there &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; research direction and personal freedom; it’s not “we are literally dead if we don’t ship.”
I did that, it was fun. It was crazy. It was stressful. I’d love to do that again at some point. 
I really want to experience the creative freedom and direction and &lt;em&gt;exploration&lt;/em&gt; that grad school affords.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;academia--affective-computing&quot;&gt;Academia &amp;amp; Affective Computing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HAVE YOU HEARD THE GOOD NEWS?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;imc src=&quot;/images/goodnews.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Affective Computing is the thing I always loved and didn’t know was real. I literally
didn’t know there was a field for studying emotion in the way I &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; it: logically, reasonably, 
with nuance and complexity, and as a dramatic enhancement to my experience on this planet. 
I have never understood why people shied away from it (why STILL indeed?) since it seems like 
the most blatant necessity in the coming “AI revolution.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Honestly, if I had had my shit together coming out of undergrad, I would have applied sooner. But I didn’t,
and that’s actually way better. I didn’t know how to handle myself right out of undergrad,
and now I not only know how to write great code and do like basic time management, but I have
a profound appreciation for my own interest in this field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seriously, I was never one to read white papers for fun (except cognitive neuroscience, Phil Holcolmbe was the best prof)
until I discovered this field because DAMN how can you not!? It’s annoying to me that
I understand my passion so deeply that it almost doesn’t even feel like there are words for it… 
it’s just obvious that rigorously and computationally studying empathy and communication is what I’m meant to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;empathy&quot;&gt;Empathy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over a year ago I met my best friend, Ms. Claire Duvallet. Over the course of one year, she 
has prompted more self-reflection and growth than any other influence in my life. She speaks to me
in a way that I hear so uniquely, and goes so deep in our interests. Here’s the thing though: there’s only
one of her. I am grateful for her friendship, and think about how she helps me; how could her lessons
be distilled and passed on?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If she teaches me because she adjusts her communication style to me, then surely a machine 
or automated coach could do something similar. This is going to revolutionize &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lucky for me, MIT seems to be on the education kick too. But obviously it’s so much more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s more than customized lesson plans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s more than actually helpful UI that doesn’t annoy you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s more than empathetic&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=woebot&amp;amp;rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS747US750&amp;amp;oq=woebot&amp;amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.2632j0j1&amp;amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8&quot;&gt;therapy bots.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s more than &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.media.mit.edu/projects/engageme/overview/&quot;&gt;helping autistic children &lt;/a&gt;learn social skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s fucking scary. It’s marketing, targeting you. It’s cognitive scientists, bayesian modelers, and the most crooked
CEOs you can dream up manipulating you into buying their products. It’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cnn.com/2017/10/27/politics/trump-campaign-wikileaks-cambridge-analytica/index.html&quot;&gt;manipulating 
the cultural psyche&lt;/a&gt;. It’s FUCKING TERRIFYING.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m a good guy. I want to be there to fight bad guys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Empathy is this beautiful tool that is like a dope double-edged sword of justice, that both
increases world awesome &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; decreases world suck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;why-grad-school&quot;&gt;“Why Grad School?”&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;im-jealous-of-my-friends&quot;&gt;I’m jealous of my friends&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am so envious of my graduate school friends. Every time they invite me to a lecture, or a talk, or 
an interesting speaker or event, I want to go. I’m working hard at the office(s) and that’s fine and dandy
but &lt;em&gt;damn&lt;/em&gt; do I wish I could leave from 2:30-4:00 most Tuesdays and Thursdays. I’ve started doing it
more often, but I just wish it were my &lt;em&gt;job&lt;/em&gt; to learn new things and become inspired by 
brilliant speakers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;i-havent-met-the-one&quot;&gt;I haven’t met “the one”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just know where they live. I don’t yet know what problem is going to be MINE yet, 
but now I know how to get there. It’s Emotional AI. It’s Affective Computing. Yo, do you
 think Rosalind Picard would think it’s weird if I wrote her thanking her for inventing
 this field like 40 years before I would be able to?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;i-just-know&quot;&gt;I Just Know™&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve always known. My professors have known, my parents have known, my friends have known. 
I’m just cut out for grad school. I thrive in the chaos and the creativity and the rigor 
and stress and want to steep in it like an intellectual tea bag.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most honest thing I can say is: the more I research and look into the groups
I want to work for and learn about the field, the more ideas I have. The bigger my 
excitement gets. The stronger the passion. The more I want it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last time I &lt;em&gt;knew&lt;/em&gt; something like this was in my first computer science course. 
 I love the feeling. I love just &lt;em&gt;knowing&lt;/em&gt;. It’s such a relief to have found what I want 
 to dedicate my life to. Now comes the stress of enacting exactly &lt;em&gt;where&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; that can happen.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Carolyn Saund</name><email>carolyn.saund@gmail.com</email></author><category term="grad school" /><category term="PhD" /><category term="diary" /><summary type="html">An honest, cheeky, unfiltered brain dump of why I’m ready to go back.

&lt;h2 id=&quot;introduce-yourself-who-are-you-where-do-you-work&quot;&gt;Introduce yourself! Who are you? Where do you work?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hi! I’m Carolyn. I graduated from Tufts university in beautiful Somerville, Massachusetts, USA with degrees in Cognitive Science and Computer Science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the past two years I worked at a social robotics startup called Jibo, where I started out building the robot’s SDK and transitioned into writing more far-reaching backend systems that focus on infusing character and personality into Jibo’s emotions, speech, and interactions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently moved to Cogito (founded by a Kiwi from Wellington!), which does conversational analysis. Although I’m technically on the web team here, my role involves full-stack development and lots of thinking about data architecture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I’m not typing furiously on overly-clicky mechanical keyboards, you can find me on the field playing ultimate frisbee or stumbling through mountains with friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;who-or-what-got-you-into-programming&quot;&gt;Who or what got you into programming?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was actually a stroke of luck that my university’s Cognitive Science program required two CS classes. I signed up for the intro course my very first semester “to get it out of the way.” By the second project I knew I loved it, and by the third I was ready to major in it. When I went to tell my professor, he laughed and pulled out a piece of paper; he had already registered me as his advisee! I guess sometimes you Just Know 😍&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;you-seem-very-interested-artificial-intelligence-and-machine-learning-what-is-it-about-this-field-that-interests-you&quot;&gt;You seem very interested artificial intelligence and machine learning! What is it about this field that interests you?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My background in Cognitive Science really informs my computational interests. I approach programming as a tool to be used to better understand the brain and our own thinking systems. It wasn’t until I worked on, developed, and shaped a huge software stack that I learned to appreciate the beauty and complexity of large software architectures. And even still, the architectural parallels between software and human thinking systems are amazing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AI and ML are still nascent fields, and although formal cognitive study has been around since the before the 50s (Minsky’s Society of Mind is considered a [thoroughly unimplementable] classic), the computational tools scientists now have are unmatched, and unlock whole new ways of thinking about thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems to me that once humans know how we ourselves think, there’s basically limitless potential for social impact. You know how your brain just sometimes does really cool shit? Imagine if we knew how to invoke that all the time. Imagine if we knew how to balance and exploit every pathway in our thinking systems. Every single evolutionary fluke or “life hack” would become available to us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-did-working-on-an-sdk-at-jibo-teach-you-about-developer-experience-what-differences-are-there-between-developers-and-regular-consumers&quot;&gt;What did working on an SDK (at Jibo) teach you about Developer Experience? What differences are there between developers and regular consumers?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With consumers, you get the luxury of more-or-less telling them what they want. Developers know what they want, though I’ve always found them incredibly friendly and forgiving. Generally, responsiveness earns more points that being correct right off the bat, and I think that’s because of the community feeling. Devs like helping devs because, hey, we’re all devs! And at the end of the day, owning up to bugs and showing you’re listening and responding to community needs is enough to win over friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest similarity I see between groups is that everybody wants their interactions to be simple. More and more nowadays, if the consumer (dev or casual) needs to think about how to use your product, you’ve already lost. A simple interface, sensible defaults, and a foolproof safety net (think: you CANNOT fuck this up even if you try really hard) go a long way. Basically, “pretend the user is drunk” holds true for devs as well as regular consumers. 🍻&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;youve-experienced-a-computer-science-education-in-both-the-usa-and-new-zealand-what-were-the-differences-and-which-do-you-prefer&quot;&gt;You’ve experienced a computer science education in both the USA and New Zealand. What were the differences and which do you prefer?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest difference is definitely the amount of work I was expected to do outside of class. In the US, at least two of my undergrad classes were 40+ hours/week. For one class. There’s this huge expectation of spending a ton of time working on problem sets and projects, and I truly believe that 100% of the work I did made me a better engineer. “Better,” in this case, means more thoughtful and aware of the deeper problems which underlie and inform implementation. So in New Zealand I felt, at least time-wise, underextended.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also felt really silly raising my hand to ask questions in class. In the US, my classes were generally fueled and entirely driven by students taking the lecture in whatever direction and at the pace we felt ready, whereas in NZ although the professor told me he liked when I asked questions, it was clear from my peers that that’s just not how it’s done. To be honest I never really adjusted, and asked anyway. My philosophy is “I’m a generally intelligent human, if I can’t follow this then somebody else is probably also lost, and if not I’m in way over my head anyway, so fuck it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another huge difference was the gender ratio. At Tufts the intro CS classes are 50/50 M/F, and we generally graduate at a ratio of about 65/35. In New Zealand, while there were other women in the department, I was the only woman in two of my CS classes, and one of three in the other. And these were big, lecture-style, 30-50 person classes! I found my group of friends eventually (holla atcha SAM) but it was much more intimidating than I thought it would be, and left me with a lot of empathy for less-outspoken demographic minorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-has-been-your-toughest-lesson-to-learn-in-your-software-career-so-far&quot;&gt;What has been your toughest lesson to learn in your software career so far?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the business lessons have been the hardest. You can work on something awesome that you love, but at the end of the day, it has to make money. You have to sacrifice doing it right for getting it done by a deadline, and you have to sacrifice implementing cool new features for hardening your code. Basically, the software equivalent of eating your veggies. That being said, now I so so so greatly appreciate good test coverage!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But a much harder lesson I have to say, and I hate to say it, is that gender discrimination is definitely a thing. It hasn’t affected me on a personal level too much, but I do see it – regularly, and pervasively. I was extremely lucky to be shielded from it for as long as I was, but in The Real World™ it’s tough to swallow the fact that I’m just going to have to work harder to get some people to take me seriously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-would-be-your-number-one-piece-of-advice-for-a-successful-software-career-so-far&quot;&gt;What would be your number one piece of advice for a successful software career (so far)?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Work as a team, and own your decisions. If you made a decision that turned out to be technically foolish, acknowledge it and, with your team, fix it. Don’t make excuses, just learn and move on. On the flip side, if a team member makes a mistake, that’s ok! Allow everybody the space to mess up and find solutions together. Programming is, when done right, one of the most social jobs around, because you have to constantly be fitting moving pieces together. It’s so satisfying when you can step back with a close-knit team and see this goliath thing you’ve build that you never could have accomplished yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, don’t be afraid to self promote. Remember, if you hit every “requirement” in the job description, you’re overqualified. Take risks, learn fast, be passionate about not knowing the answer and discovering new ways of thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;when-you-mime-programming-to-somebody-do-you-use-t-rex-arms-or-wiggly-fingers&quot;&gt;When you mime programming to somebody, do you use T-rex arms, or wiggly fingers?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;T-rex arms, hands down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love being subscribed to javascript weekly. It’s a great, succinct way to see what’s coming up in the ecosystem, and it’s made me a better dev to have some foresight. I also subscribe to CB Insights, which is a little more involved but I love his sarcastic tone and the firm’s quick updates on VC trends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I strongly recommend Godel, Escher, Bach to all computationally-minded, intellectually curious conscious beings!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;8.4 on IMDB? Acclaimed by my favorite liberal news source The New York Times? 97% on rotten tomatoes!? I was all in. In hindsight, I should have known. I should have listened to that little voice in my head during the trailers that said “jeez, she sure is scantily clad for this to be a feminist film.” I should have recognized that sinking feeling I get when I see a Classic Love Interest™ highlighted as a main plot point. I should have listened to my gut when it said “this is too good to be true.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the truth is, I was blindsided. After all, the film had just passed the Bechdel test like five times when they make the Chris-Pine-has-a-big-penis joke ten minutes in. I laughed along, unaware of the pain to come. “Ha ha, I, too, would wonder what male genitalia looked like if I grew up in a society of women!” Never mind the fact that on this island paradise, everybody was bare-shouldered and bare-thighed, along with shockingly beautiful. It’s an island paradise! It’s hot out! Besides, it’s an island of all women, and surely a girl’s gotta attract the hotties, men or women. These were my thoughts as I wrote off these harmless signs. But in the final scenes of Themyscira, when Diana and her boo sail away and our naive heroine makes the point that it’s silly for him to not sleep with her, I got an inkling this might not be the “feminist triumph” I was promised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How was I to know that after the first 10 minutes, there would be only two more female characters, and never again would female characters speak to one another? (Yes, I am leaving out the secretary one-liner commenting on her clothes, and I am leaving out the one line of an enslaved woman crying for help in the battlefield. Those aren’t the Bechdel test). How could I have guessed that Diana would draw her strength, ultimately, from her love for Chris Pine? What would have tipped me off that even our female villain would play mono-dimensional second fiddle to her commander? (Oh riiiiiiight, the skirt…)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../../../../images/wonderwoman.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;wonderwoman&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just look at that protective armor!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Diana turns out to be the anti-feminist heroine that Hollywood wants to believe is “progress.” She fights people! She kills people! That’s certainly not very lady-like! So what if she’s doing it in little more than a bathing suit (albeit, one-piece!)? It’s “true to the story.” And that she just happens to be totally naive to the ways of the world (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0thpEyEwi80&amp;amp;vl=ru&quot;&gt;why is this attractive!?&lt;/a&gt;). And strangely curious about sex, despite revealing that the Amazons deem men “unnecessary for pleasure.” Maybe she’s bisexual? And that’s progressive? We just only get to think about her having sex with women, and see her having sex with men… progressive, right guys?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Diana leaves Themyscira, her mother says “the world of men does not deserve you.” Throughout the film, this harken back to Dark Knight (“not the hero we deserve, but the hero we need”) is reiterated multiple times. But when Diana finally realizes her power, it’s drawn only from the loss of her love. Batman was about selfless sacrifice — about being a hero even when you will never be known for it, when you will fall because of it! Batman was the martyr, the complex character who made a non-standard choice of becoming a villain or ruining his own (superhero) life — aka giving up the only thing that brought him purpose in life. Wonder Woman got a boring-ass, played-out, contrived choice: join me and we rule the world together, or save humans and be adored by them. Whatever — that doesn’t make this film anti-feminist, it just makes it boring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All this, and I still haven’t gotten to the fact that Chris Pine is actually the hero of this movie. Unlike Diana and her one-dimensional harping I-will-kill-Aries-and-save-the-world over and over and over, we get to see his character evolve. He has an intensely internal moral compass, following his gut but also commands. He’s willing to change his mind about who he trusts and works for, he’s evolving even as he’s executing on a plan he knows may ultimately kill him, he protects and trusts his friends, and they trust him with their lives and more. Sure, the romance between Diana and him is strangely rushed and never really developed (maybe its’ small-ish role is a feminist win?) but somebody needs to say “I love you” in the end. Also, low key, he literally leads Diana around the entire film, including my very favorite “I am grabbing your hand and we are running now” (that is not my favorite).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../../../../images/chrispine.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;chrispine&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
Hello I am Chris Pine. Love me heterosexually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the penultimate scene, Aries basically says “humans are the worst.” Diana responds with “they are… but they’re so much more.” This is a vague-ass line, and it’s all she says on the matter! We can only assume she’s drawing from her love for Piney boy who just sacrificed himself (martyrdom: the ultimate show of character) but it is totally unclear what she means here. She doesn’t even get a speech at the end! Her final words to us are just her opening monologue literally repeated word for word.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trailers even prepped us for a girl-power extravaganza! To be honest, one sound bite of the tens that Diana pours about saving the world and destroying Aries sounds pretty good amid a gorgeous woman beating up Nazis. I feel misled and betrayed. Kind of like Diana, I guess, maybe? If I identify with the main (female) character, that makes me like this all, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ya know, if you just love superhero movies and can’t see past “STUFF BLEW UP AND IT WAS AWESOME,” that’s cool. I don’t really care that this is a terrible, boring film whose only redeeming quality is fight choreography (even then, it was really just the same cool effects done about fifteen times). What gets me is people are saying this is a feminist WIN! Seriously, fellow humans? You think this is what passes as feminism? News flash: just because the film is named after a female character does NOT make it automatically pro-female-equality. It just pisses me off because it could have been so easy to make it more egalitarian! Change the linguist’s gender and boom: you’ve got another female character. Let Diana and Dr. Whatsherface meet and KA-POW women interacting with women without male supervision! Somehow you managed to put a Native American in rural France during WWI and no one asks questions (actually, no questions, well done), but you couldn’t work a woman into war efforts? Give me a break.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s be clear about one thing: this isn’t feminism, this is a joke. Give me a real female lead with literally any character development and at least one female friend. That is actually all I ask. If you think this film, or my ask, is equality, set higher standards for yourself and for Hollywood.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Carolyn Saund</name><email>carolyn.saund@gmail.com</email></author><category term="feminsm" /><category term="hollywood" /><summary type="html">Obligatory Spoiler Alert.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">On Fleece Pants</title><link href="https://csaund.github.io/posts/2017/07/on-fleece-pants/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="On Fleece Pants" /><published>2017-05-22T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2017-05-22T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>https://csaund.github.io/posts/2017/07/blog-post-5</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://csaund.github.io/posts/2017/07/on-fleece-pants/">&lt;p&gt;Just some great pants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;i-would-like-to-find-the-man&quot;&gt;I would like to find the man&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would like to find the man from whom I stole These Fleece Pants. The black ones that I’m wearing now, as I watch the sunrise and wait for my friends to wake up. Fish jump out of the water, just enough to catch the bugs. They make a small “splsh” sound, leave tiny ripples across the otherwise glassy lake, and dive down into the clear water. Earlier, These Pants ran from the fire pit — where I failed to re-establish last nights’ embers — to the picnic bench, where a chipmunk gnawed at the outside of the package of Dave’s Killer Bread. It was These Pants that saved our breakfast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to find you, Man-From-Whom-I-Stole-These-Pants, to thank you for letting me borrow them during our camping trip together in New Zealand, when our Land Ethics final was making our way through a dark, rainy night to an unmarked campsite. We all brought our extra gear to share; I lent you my Whisperlite stove, you lent me These Pants. I think your name was Chris, or maybe it was Tom. Everybody in New Zealand is named Tom. You were the oldest student in our class — in your 30s! I never asked you why you were studying abroad in New Zealand in your 30s, but I wish I had. Your story, of how you used These Pants before they found me, is one I would very much like to hear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the hill above the campsite where These Pants and I first met. Do you remember, Man-From-Whom-I-Stole-These-Pants?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should know that looking back now, I have no idea if I ever intended to give These Pants back to you. When the weekend was over you returned my stove, but I was still wearing These Pants. I said, “we’ll see each other around, I’ll return them to you next time we see each other.” But, Man-From-Whom-I-Stole-These-Pants, I never saw you again. I suppose, technically, I still have the chance to stay true to my word, but I do not even know your name, let alone where you live or how to find you!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should know, also, when you said “these pants are old and ratty but I guess they still work,” you were underestimating the spirit of These Pants to an unimaginable degree. They dry quickly, and have cinched edges around the feet, so they are ideal for cold, damp trips to the mountains. And as far as I can tell, they are made of miracle fabric that is soft and flexible, but durable enough to bushwhack through dense undergrowth without getting any holes. The inside of my sleeping bag knows These Pants well, because they slip over leggings and hiking pants, but ensure I take off my boots before, so they make me remember to change out of your wet socks before bed. In this way, These Pants save my feet from getting painful and soggy on long trips. On the last day out, I don’t even have to change in the morning, and just hike out wearing These Pants. This quality lets them see landscapes around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- Not pictured: These Pants --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cool wetness, however, is not just found at high altitudes. These Pants bring me to misty beaches around the world. Later in the year after These Pants were bestowed upon me, I wear them on a chilly day in the Coromandel on Hot Water Beach, where they become covered in sand. We only have one shovel between five of us, so I get down in These Pants and dig with my hands, searching for hot spots in the earth. When at last we have a make-shift jacuzzi just out of reach of the waves, I strip off and carelessly discard These Pants in the pile of sticky, wet sand. We laugh for hours at the rising tide, abandoning our hard-won pool only once we are thoroughly pruned and the waves finally drown our hot water with the freezing Pacific. As we walk back to the rusty old Subaru, I only barely remember to grab These Pants. They are filthy, but well-spirited. They forgive me for my neglect, and join me on my flight home. At this point, we both know that we will never see Man-From-Whom-I-Stole-These-Pants again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in California, These Pants warm me as I walk along the eastern edge of the Pacific Rim. Together we pine for more adventure, and so we build a bonfire with old friends on the Santa Cruz beach. I am fairly sure this is illegal, but the night is so cold with just These Pants and a tank top (winter in California, huh). Besides, who makes fire illegal at the beach. These Pants and I huddle with Erik, Nathan, and Liliana, exchanging stories and giggles about absurdities like only college students can. We don’t drink, even though we’re all old enough now, because we want to remember what it feels like to be in love with the world together. The next morning, I wear These Pants on our second flight together, to my second home in Somerville, Massachusetts. We are greeted by the Polar Vortex, and in the first three months of owning them, I have been in a full 100ºF temperature range with These Pants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- These Pants on the Routeburn Track --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel bleak in this winter tundra. My body aches to be outside again. These Pants have no defenses against mosquito bites, and they do not bolster my confidence against giant spiders that inhabit the woods, but they remind me of the immense freedom of the wilderness. Prior to North America, I don’t think These Pants had ever seen a proper trail — just open landscape to explore. I lay every night in my bed and listen to the train rumble by, dreaming of waking up in valleys filled with yellow tufts of grass, where the “route” I am meant to follow is a stony river. In my dreams I wear These Pants while I drink straight from snowy runoff streams. In Real Life, I wear These Pants on inconveniently-timed video calls to my far-away friends. I wear These Pants while I cry because my Adventure Life feels so far removed from Who I Am here. I wear These Pants when I eat whole giant bags of cheddar-flavored popcorn. I wear These Pants while I study for finals by myself in the library at 2am. I wear These Pants when I walk home in the dark.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- Not Pictured: These Pants --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These Pants keep the outdoors on my mind, but I wear them exclusively indoors after I get the tattoo on my thigh. These are the only pants I own that are loose around the top of my legs, so I wear them basically nonstop for a month, until it heals. I thought I would be wearing dresses when I got it done, but it is a cold April in Boston 2014, so the entire campus has seen These Pants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- This is the picture I brought that the artist traced onto my leg. Now it’s immortalized right next to the patch of freckles on my left thigh. --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tattoo is a Koru spiral — a shape which I learned about nearly ten months before, in our class together, Man-From-Whom-I-Stole-These-Pants. You remember. The spiral represents how we all start our lives in one place, but we grow and change in different ways throughout our lives, getting further and further from our starting place, taking longer to make wide-reaching changes to ourselves, but always with a connection to our center. We often find amber capsules of our old selves, way points we pass in our journeys through life, in artifacts. In the old Maori days, it was with tools, or pounamu jewelry (pictured left), or even with mental connections to sacred places. Nowadays, it can be with old diaries or trinkets, like music boxes or stuffed animals. It can be with smells like Grandma’s kitchen before the pinched nerve, when her hands were still good enough to bake. It can be with a pair of earrings, shoes, or pants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These Pants are perfect for making memories at home. Because they are so easily washable after they charge through wilderness, it doesn’t feel bad to get them messy when I make art. This is how These Pants get the red and pink splotch of oil paint in the inside of the left thigh — right over the tattoo — as I make an attempt at an oil painting of an Autumnal Forest. I give that painting to Rhyan when she moves to New York. I lie when I say I don’t like it because it’s no good (it isn’t) but she disagrees and takes it with her, to reminder her of me in her new apartment. I’m glad, because I’m secretly quite proud of it. When I visit her, it hangs in her bedroom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- In this photo, but not visible: These Pants --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two summers after These Pants and I met, we started a new urban adventure in the form of Sports, and I discovered they are unmatched in the area of sideline clothing. These Pants have consequently watched countless ultimate frisbee games at Harvard Stadium, and belayed countless partners up the walls at Rumney. They have cheered for the All Blacks, the New Zealand national rugby team; The Red Sox, my favorite American League baseball team (don’t worry, I’ll always be a Giants fan); The Leaf Cutters, my Costa Rican destination tournament ultimate team. These Pants stay warm even on drizzly tournament days that the team hopes will be rain outs, but never are. They slip on over uniform shorts and off over cleats, and they don’t mind when the wind kicks up dust storms on unkempt fields.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- Our campsite last night. These Pants blocked by a very exciting bell pepper. --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These Pants have been covered in every substance I encounter with any frequency. From sideline dust to sand, water, beer, bug spray, sunscreen, ink, paint, maple syrup, hot sauce, mud, dog saliva, pizza, peanut butter, pond scum, ketchup (or tomahto sauce as the case may be), barbecue sauce, chocolate, sawdust, white-out, glue, acrylic, guacamole, bacon grease, bicycle grease, ocean water, lake water, tree sap, coffee, metallic silver film development bath, pastels, molten wax, pastry dough, cinnamon, honey, hand sanitizer, cat hair, dog hair, horse hair, vinegar, hair spray, glitter, whiskey, hair dye — but These Pants don’t mind my sloppiness; they welcome being a part of the experiences. Everything has a story behind it. Everything washes out. Everything, somehow, except the smell of smoke. These Pants smell like hot summer campfire nights of eating three s’mores made with jumbo marshmallows. Of snowy ice-climbing with quasi-strangers in the White Mountains. Of cooking meat on an open fire where there are no bears, and foil packets filled with grilled vegetables where there are. They smell like the flameless embers that are the only things that singe tiny holes into their calves when I add pinecones to flames that are already high enough. They smell like soot and ash that rise when I kick over the last log under the stars right before I sleep. These Pants smell like both the beginnings and ends of adventures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so, Man-From-Whom-I-Stole-These-Pants, I would like to thank you. Thank you for the joy and warmth and comfort of the past four years. Thank you for the excuse and ability to go outside on spontaneous trips. For helping me pack for 72 hours in 5 minutes. Thank you for the innumerable sunrises and sets and their accompanying dusks and dawns, for the unimaginable beauty I am so grateful to witness. Thank you for this morning, in a grove of trees in front of a glassy lake with my best friends asleep behind me. Thank you for These Pants.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Carolyn Saund</name><email>carolyn.saund@gmail.com</email></author><category term="outdoors" /><category term="fleece pants" /><category term="go outside" /><summary type="html">Just some great pants.</summary></entry></feed>
