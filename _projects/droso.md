Introduction
============
Named after the countless genetic studies done on the species, the Drosophila
 project uses genetic algorithms to produce unique light patterns on a "badge"
  display that can be "recombined" with other nearby badges.

The Genetic Material
====================
The genome in this project operates on traits which are discrete from one 
another, but which operate under unique rules. The traits modeled in this 
genome are light color, flash pattern, genetic greediness, and When badges 
swap material over NFC, they algorithmically recombine, and each badge 
becomes an offspring of the two parent badges. Interestingly, when offspring 
badges repeatedly recombine with only each other, the traits of the badges 
quickly converge to form not-very-interesting and highly-likely patterns, 
and their genetic variation approaches 0. We've never been able to totally 
remove all genetic variation, but we have observed totally stagnant 
phenotypic variation.

Flash Pattern
=============
There are five unique flash patterns modeled in this version of the badge, 
which operate under straightfoward dominance/recessive trait characteristics.
 The patterns are:
all on
clockwise rotation
counterclockwise rotation
every other LED flashes
every LED flashes

Color
=====
Colors per genome are described using one RGB value and a function vs. time 
per LED of variance from one RGB value. When badges recombine, their starting 
RGB values average and one function is randomly selected for all offspring.
 Note that this means that if badge A has color pattern `f(x)`, it could 
 recombine with badge B and both A and B would end with color pattern 
 `f(x)` -- overwriting B's function -- and recombine with `f(c)` and end 
 with both A and C with color pattern `g(x)`. No function is automatically 
 dominant over any other.

Greediness
==========
"Greediness" is defined in this project as a genotypes affinity to "protect 
itself," or its' likelihood to pass its' own traits onto offspring. 
Genotypes with high greediness are more likely to produce offspring with 
at least one trait exactly like the parent. The implementation of this is 
straightforward, as parameter G in each algorithm is evaluated prior to 
genetic exchange for each trait, and if exceeds a threshold within a 
percentage for each trait, the recombination does not occur and only that 
parents genotype is in the pool of offspring. In recombination, greediness 
averages with its co-parent for each offspring. For example, if badge 
A has `G=0.1` and badge B has `G=0.6`, prior to each trait recombination will 
come this evaluation:
```
r = randint(1, 100)` // get a threshold to exceed
m = randint(1, 100)  // get a multiplier
aExceeds = m(A.G) > r
bExceeds = m(B.G) > r
```
if both numbers exceed the threshold, they recombine as normal.
