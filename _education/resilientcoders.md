I was the Cogito corporate sponsor and technical mentor for Resilient Coders --
an organization which trains non-traditional background adult students to become software developers.
I developed a 8-week "boot camp" curriculum for two students who were ultimately
able to use Cogito APIs to create a product MVP.
