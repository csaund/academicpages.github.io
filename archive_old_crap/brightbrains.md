Responsibly reporting neuroscientific findings.
“IMMORTALITY POSSIBLE? World&#39;s first human head transplant &#39;successfully&#39; carried out,”
reads the headline of the top google result for “head transplant” (2). Although this is a
particularly egregious example of reporting gone awry, it is true that simply because
neuroscience and psychology are inseparably linked, the public is keen to interpret findings
and extrapolate wildly about the nature of humanity. It is absolutely necessary that we, as a
cohesive scientific community, ensure the public understands what we are and are not doing
-- what is and is not possible.
Most people only read about 20% of online articles (1). When the goal of a journalist is to get
the most clicks, it is vital that the biggest nugget journalists can extract from our research is
not a debased interpretation of what we’re really doing. Here are a few excellent ways I’ve
seen scientists debunk myths around their research to general consumers.
Get involved in public outreach campaigns. In order to be in control of the message,
researchers can start the conversation. When we initiate public discussion around our
research topics, we can manage expectations and misconceptions directly, face-to-face with
the people we hope to impact most. As a bonus, we de-mystify the scientific process while
we’re at it.
Review the university press release. Although we’re not in control of how media outlets
spin it, we can ensure the source-of-truth of any scientific reporting is accurate. We often
have more power within our own universities to correct errors or misleading phrasing than
with general consumer publications.
Create and publish guides for readers. When we know our research could be
mischaracterized, we can write up FAQs that are easily understandable, and post them in
public places, like researchers from MIT with their important study investigating mortality
after Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico (3). Filtering out jargon helps casual consumers gain an
intuition for what findings mean, and how they can and can or cannot be applied.
We, as scientists, are in extremely powerful positions as gatekeepers to knowledge.
Consequently, we also must uphold our duty to ensure findings are properly reported, de-
sensationalized, and understood by broad audiences.
