title: "Multiple Metaphors in Metaphoric Gesturing"
collection: publications
permalink: /publications/acii2019
excerpt: 'The use of metaphoric gestures by speakers has
long been known to influence thought in the viewer. What is
less clear is the extent to which the expression of multiple
metaphors in a single gesture reliably affect viewer interpretation.
Additionally, gestures which express only one metaphor are not
sufficient to explain the broad array of metaphoric gestures and
metaphoric scenes that human speakers naturally produce. In
this paper we address three issues related to the implementation
of metaphoric gestures in virtual humans. First, we break down
naturally occurring examples of multiple-metaphor gestures, as
well as metaphoric scenes created by gesture sequences. Then, we
show the importance of capturing multiple metaphoric aspects
of gesture with a behavioral experiment using crowdsourced
judgements of videos of alterations of the naturally occurring
gestures. Finally, we discuss the challenges for computationally
modeling metaphoric gestures that are raised by our findings.'
